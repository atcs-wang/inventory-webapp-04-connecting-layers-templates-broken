# Part 04: Connecting the Layers: Rendering templates with data

This tutorial follows after:
[Part 03: Database Layer: Database connection and first table set-up](https://github.com/atcs-wang/inventory-webapp-03-db-connection-setup/)

Technologies: [EJS (Embedded JavaScript templating)](https://ejs.co/)

In this tutorial, we will connect all three layers, making our server render the web app's pages with data from the database. 

## (4.1) The big picture:

[Two tutorials ago](https://github.com/atcs-wang/inventory-webapp-02-app-server-basics#making-a-simple-app-server-for-our-prototypes), we set up "routes" in `app.js` telling our Express web server to handle incoming HTTP requests from client browsers, and respond with static HTML files or other static resources. 

>```
>Browser --- request ---> App Server
>Browser <-- response --- App Server
>```

[Last tutorial](https://github.com/atcs-wang/inventory-webapp-03-db-connection-setup#read-the-table-step-44), we used NodeJS to connect and execute queries to our MySQL database, and the database would return data back. 

>```
>App Server --- query --> Database
>App Server <-- data ---- Database
>```


We will now combine those two concepts into a web server that responds to HTTP requests in a way that depends on the current state of the database. 
This kind of server generally follows the following pattern: 
1. The web server receives an HTTP request
2. The web server makes a relevant query to the database
3. The web server waits for the data to be returned
4. The web server uses the data to form and send the HTTP response. 

>```
> Browser --- request ---> App Server
>                          App Server --- query --> Database
>                          App Server <-- data ---- Database
> Browser <-- response --- App Server
>```

There are a variety of formats the response might take: it could be raw data from the database (e.g. plaintext or JSON) or fully formed HTML pages based on data. Such database-driven HTML pages are considered ***dynamic***, rather than static. 

In the first part of the tutorial, we'll just focus on making our server query the database upon HTTP request, and simply respond with that raw data. 

In the second part of the tutorial, we'll upgrade the reponse to HTML pages rendered **dynamically** - that is, *containing* that data.

## (4.2) Responding with raw data (JSON) [Part 1/2]: 

Before we can execute any database queries, we need `app.js` to `require()` the connection object we defined in `db/db_connection.js`. Add this line to the top of the file with the other `require` statements.

```js
const db = require('./db/db_connection');
```

### (4.2.1) Making the `/stuff` route respond with data
Currently the `/stuff` route looks like this:

```js
app.get( "/stuff", ( req, res ) => {
    res.sendFile( __dirname + "/views/stuff.html" );
} );
```
As it is, requests for `/stuff` are immediately responded to with the `stuff.html` prototype. 

The client is ostensibly interested in a summary list of all items in the `'stuff'` table in the database. This means the app server will need to execute the following SQL query upon request: 
```sql
SELECT 
    id, item, quantity
FROM
    inventory
```
*(also in `db/queries/crud/read_stuff_all.sql`)*


Replace the code for the `/stuff` route with this code instead:
```js
// define a route for the stuff inventory page
const read_stuff_all_sql = `
    SELECT 
        id, item, quantity
    FROM
        stuff
`
app.get( "/stuff", ( req, res ) => {
    db.execute(read_stuff_all_sql, (error, results) => {
        if (error)
            res.status(500).send(error); //Internal Server Error
        else
            res.send(results);
    });
});
```

and run the server again:
```
> node app.js
```

and visit `localhost:8080/stuff` on your browser. Now, instead of an HTML page, you should see some plaintext with JSON-style data from the database:

```
[ { "id": 1, "item": "Widgets", "quantity": 5 }, 
  { "id": 2, "item": "Gizmos", "quantity": 100 }, 
  { "id": 3, "item": "Thingamajig", "quantity": 12345 }, 
  { "id": 4, "item": "Thingamabob", "quantity": 54321 } 
]
```

Great! Let's break down the new code:
- **When does the app server respond now?** The route handler doesn't send a response right away anymore - first, it sends a query to the database, then waits for the query results via another *nested* handler callback function before responding. (Nested callback functions can be a bit disorienting at first.) 
- **How does the server know if the database executed the query successfully?**  Our database might be respond too slowly or fail to execute the query for a wide range of reasons (e.g. malformed SQL, network failure, database is busy/slow). The opening `if (error)` statement in the callback function is the standard way of checking this. In case of failure, the `error` parameter in the callback function will be some kind of error message object (a "truthy" value). Otherwise, `error` will be `undefined` (a "falsy" value). 
- **If the database does NOT return results successfully?** Our response should have an appropriate status code of `500 Internal Server Error`. It can be helpful (at least during development) to also report what went wrong, so we can send the error object too. The `res.status(500).send(error)` in the if block accomplishes this.
- **Otherwise, if the database DOES return results successfully?**  In the else block, `res.send(results)` will send a response with a default `200 OK` status code and a body containing the `results` serialized as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). 

> If you'd like to see the error message response in play, temporarily change your database password in the `.env` file and restart your server to create errors on every request. Check both the server logs in the terminal and the browser's developer tools (Inspect -> Network) to confirm that the status code is indeed `500 Internal Server Error`.

### 4.2.2 Making the `/stuff/item` route respond with data

Currently the `/stuff/item` route looks like this:

```js
app.get( "/stuff", ( req, res ) => {
    res.sendFile( __dirname + "/views/stuff.html" );
} );
```

As it is, requests for `/stuff` are immediately responded to with the `item.html` prototype. 

The client is interested in data about a particular item in the stuff table. This could be any item, which are uniquely identified by the column `id`. 

This means the app server will need to execute the following SQL query upon request: 
```sql
SELECT 
    item, quantity, description 
FROM
    inventory
WHERE 
    id = ?
```
*(also in `db/queries/crud/read_item.sql`)*

where the `?` placeholder must be filled in with the appropriate id.

#### (4.2.2.1) Prepared statements with manual values

Let's assume for a minute (as the prototype does) that the client wants the first item in the table, with `id = 1`.

Replace the code for the `/stuff/item` route with this code instead:
```js
// define a route for the item detail page
const read_item_sql = `
    SELECT 
        item, quantity, description 
    FROM
        stuff
    WHERE
        id = ?
`
app.get( "/stuff/item", ( req, res ) => {
    db.execute(read_item_sql, [1], (error, results) => {
        if (error)
            res.status(500).send(error); //Internal Server Error
        else
            res.send(results[0]); // results is still an array
    });
});
```

If you run your server again and navigate your browser to `localhost:8080/stuff/item`, you should receive data like this:
```
{"item":"Widgets","quantity":5,"description":"Widgets are cool! You can do ... so many... different things... with them..."}
```

Notice the route handler is very similar (for now) to the `/stuff` route from earlier. The only differences are:

1. To assign the placeholder `?` in the SQL a value of `1`, the second parameter of the `db.execute()` method is passed an array containing `1`. This technique is known as a "prepared statement", and was demonstrated in `db/db_init.js` in the previous tutorial. (There is more discussion about prepared statements and why they are used below...)
2. Results for a `SELECT` statement are always arrays, even if only one row is selected. The response here only needs to send the element in the first index of the results, not the entire results array. (Of course, if no such element exists, an `undefined` will be sent instead! We'll also address this more below.. )


#### (4.2.2.2) URL parameters - allowing the client to specify prepared statement values.

Naturally, the client would like to see data for any of the items in the table, not just the one with `id = 1`. How can the client specify which item `id` they want? 

Imagine a route system where the information for item `1` is at the URL path `stuff/item/1`, item `2` is at `stuff/item/2`, and so on so forth. We call that `id` number embedded in the URL a **URL parameter**, and Express has a very easy way to utilize them.

Let's change the route path from
```js
app.get( "/stuff/item", ...
```
to 
```js
app.get( "/stuff/item/:id",
```
This makes the route apply to *any* URL path of the pattern `/stuff/item/:id`, where `:id` can be any (non-blank) value. 

The `:id` part declares a URL parameter `id`. In the route handler, all URL parameters are sub-properties of the `req.params` property. So `req.params.id` will contain the value of the `:id` part of the URL.

If you see where this is going, the next change is very natural: replace the `1` in the `db.execute()`'s second parameter with `req.params.id`. Now, the SQL prepared statement will use the `id` parameter from the URL as the value of `id` in the query!

Together, the updated route and handler look like this:

```js
app.get( "/stuff/item/:id", ( req, res, next ) => {
    db.execute(read_item_sql, [req.params.id], (error, results) => {
    ...
```

Test it by navigating your browser to `localhost:8080/stuff/item/1`, then replace the `1` with `2` and other numbers. You should see data for the various corresponding items. 

> Why are we using "prepared statements" to construct the SQL query from the URL parameter, instead of simple concatenation, backtick string literals, or even `string.replace`? A user can put anything at all in the URL parameter - so malicious users might try to "inject" their own custom SQL statements, potentially causing the database to execute SQL statements the developers didn't intend to be run. This is called an **SQL injection attack**, and is primarily attempted in order to gain unauthorized access to protected data.
>
> Although our app doesn't have any such authorization limits *yet*, we still don't want any security holes that invite mayhem (see the [popular xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/327/) which gives a humorous idea of the kind of mayhem SQL injections could cause). Thankfully, prepared statements perform a number of "sanitization" measures to prevent injection, essentially "escaping" inputs so they are not ever interpreted as executable SQL commands.

#### (4.2.2.3) Send a 404 when item not found.

If you try a URL like `localhost:8080/stuff/item/BADID`, you'll see a blank page. Since no item with `id = BADID` exists, the query's `results` are an empty array, and `results[0]` is undefined. This isn't a database error (the query executed correctly) so a `500` status code is inappropriate, but since the data being requested wasn't found, a status code of `404 Not Found` should be sent along with a more informative message.

Update the callback code with a new "else if" clause:
```js
    if (error)
        res.status(500).send(error); //Internal Server Error
    else if (results.length == 0)
        res.status(404).send(`No item found with id = "${req.params.id}"` ); // NOT FOUND
    else
        res.send(results[0]); // results is still an array
```

Test the server again by navigating your browser to a URL with an invalid `:id` value, such as `localhost:8080/stuff/item/BADID` or any other . Confirm that the "No item found..." message is sent. 
> You can also confirm that both the server logs in the terminal and the browser's developer tools (Inspect -> Network) show the status code is indeed `404 Not Found`.

## (4.3) Responding with rendered HTML: 

We have now seen that Express web servers can either 

**A.** send a *pre-written, static* HTML web page file ([as shown in the previous tutorial]()). We might call that kind of server a "static file server".
**B.** send *dynamic* JSON data, queried from a database ([as shown in the previous section]()). We might call that kind of server an "API server", since it acts as a thin interface between browsers and the database.

What we really want to do is a third hybrid option: send HTML pages that are  *pre-written* with *mostly static* content, but have some parts that are rendered *dynamically* with data queried from the database at the time of the request/response. This technique defines an entire kind of app architecture, and is known as **server side rendering**, or **SSR**.

>It is worth noting that our app architecture could take a very different direction called **client side rendering (CSR)**  that prefers using API servers. Generally speaking, CSR apps are **single page applications** - just the home page is provided, which then makes calls to the API server for data to *update the page's content without loading a completely different page*. We will briefly explore this architecture in a future tutorial. 

### (4.3.1) Setting up templating with EJS

To help accomplish this, we will introduce the use of **templating** - specifically, the language / framework [EJS (Embedded JavaScript templating)](https://ejs.co/). 

> There are several other templating languages / frameworks that Express can easily use instead of [EJS](https://ejs.co/):
>
> - [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) (based on Mustache)
> - [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) (formerly known as Jade)
>
> There are pros and cons to each one, but it mostly comes down to style. Feel free to explore; this particular choice is by 
> far the easiest part of the tech stack to "switch out." 

First, let's install EJS:
```
> npm install ejs
```

> If you're using VS Code, I also recommend installing the extension **EJS language support** by DigitalBrainstem.

To configure the express app to use EJS as its **'templating engine'** (aka **'view engine'**), add this code to `app.js` right after the "`//set up the server`" section and before the routing section.

```js
//set up the server
...
// Configure Express to use EJS
app.set( "views",  __dirname + "/views");
app.set( "view engine", "ejs" );
...
```

The first line specifies the `views` subdirectory as the location of all EJS **templates** (aka **views** or even **view-templates**). Our HTML prototypes are already in the `views` subdirectory, so we start by simply changing their extensions from `.html` to `.ejs`. 

> Since EJS is technically a "superset" of HTML, any valid HTML file (once the extension is changed to `.ejs`) is already a valid EJS template.

### (4.3.2) Rendering EJS with data

To render and send any template in `views`, we simply call

```js
    res.render(view, ?data);
```
where `view` is the name of the template file (minus the `.ejs`extension), and `data` is an (optional) object with all the data we want to pass to the template for dynamic rendering.

We'll be replacing every `res.sendFile` call to `res.render`, like this: 
```js
//replace every instance of:
    res.sendFile( __dirname + "/views/FILENAME.html" );
//with:
    res.render("FILENAME", data);
```

#### (4.3.2.1) Rendering the homepage (index.ejs) (1/3)

The simplest case is our homepage; we use the `index` view (which corresponds to the `index.ejs` file), but no data is passed since the page is static. We can simply update the `/` route to this:

```js
// define a route for the default home page
app.get( "/", ( req, res ) => {
    res.render('index');
});
```

For the other routes that involve querying the database, it gets more interesting.

#### (4.3.2.2)  Rendering the item detail page (item.ejs)

For the `/stuff/item/:id` route, we want to render the `item` view (`item.ejs`), but with the data in `results[0]`. 

The only part that needs to change is the else block, but here's the whole `/stuff/item/:id` route, updated:
```js
// define a route for the item detail page
app.get( "/stuff/item/:id", ( req, res ) => {
    db.execute(read_item_sql, [req.params.id], (error, results) => {
        if (error)
            res.status(500).send(error); //Internal Server Error
        else if (results.length == 0)
            res.status(404).send(`No item found with id = "${req.params.id}"` ); // NOT FOUND
        else {
            let data = results[0]; // results is still an array
            // data's object structure: 
            //  { item: ___ , quantity:___ , description: ____ }
            res.render('item', data);
        }
    });
});
```
To define how that data gets used, we now can edit `item.ejs`.

Currently, the `<table>` element has static data in it:
```html
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Item:</th>
        <td>Widgets</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Quantity:</th>
        <td>5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Description:</th>
        <td>
            Widgets are cool!
            You can do ... so many...
            different things... with them...
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
```

But as an EJS file, we can change the static data into this:

```html
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Item:</th>
        <td><%= item %></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Quantity:</th>
        <td><%= quantity %></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Description:</th>
        <td><%= description %></td>
    </tr>
</table>
```

Everything between `<% %>` tags in an EJS file gets interpreted as JavaScript snippets. In particular, using the opening tag `<%=` outputs the value of the JS expression into the template. 

All the properties of the `data` object that was passed to `res.render` are variables you can access in the JavaScript snippets in the EJS file. 

So in `item.ejs`, when you see:
```html
        ...
        <td><%= item %></td>
        ...
        <td><%= quantity %></td>
        ...
        <td><%= description %></td>
        ...

```
the rendering will inject the value of `data.item`,`data.quantity`, and `data.description` into the `<td>` elements. Note that if a value is `null` or `undefined`, the `<%=` outputs nothing.

Restart the server and visit `localhost:8080/stuff/item/1`, `/2`, `/3`, and `/4`. Magic! You should see the item page filled with data for each item.

#### (4.3.2.3) Rendering the stuff inventory page (stuff.ejs)

Finally, for the `/stuff` route, we want to render the `stuff` view (`stuff.ejs`) with *all* of the data in `results`, which is an array of objects representing items (each of which contains `id`, `item`, and `quantity` properties).

To make the whole `results` array an accessible variable by the EJS, we will set it as a property `inventory` of a new (anonymous) object that we pass as the data parameter to `res.render`.

Here's the whole `/stuff/item/:id` route, updated:

```js
// define a route for the stuff inventory page
app.get( "/stuff", ( req, res ) => {
    db.execute(read_stuff_all_sql, (error, results) => {
        if (error)
            res.status(500).send(error); //Internal Server Error
        else {
            res.render('stuff', { inventory : results });
        }
    });
} );
```

> We chose to rename `results` as `inventory` for the EJS file. But if the data object was defined as `{ results }`, the variable would still be called `results` in EJS.

Now, to use the data in `stuff.ejs`, we update the `<tbody>` element and replace the static content with the following: 

```ejs
<tbody>
    <% for (let i = 0; i < inventory.length; i++) { %>
    <tr>
        <td><%= inventory[i].item %></td>
        <td><%= inventory[i].quantity %></td>
        <td>
            <a class="btn-small waves-effect waves-light" href=<%= "/stuff/item/" + inventory[i].id %> ><i
                    class="material-icons right">edit</i>Info/Edit</a>
            <a class="btn-small waves-effect waves-light red"><i
                    class="material-icons right">delete</i>Delete</a>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <% } %>
</tbody>
```

The first JS snippet 

```ejs
<% for (let i = 0; i < inventory.length; i++) { %>
```

starts a for-loop over `inventory` (the `results`). The loop ends with the final snippets `<% } %>`. All the content inside the loop is repeated for each iteration, making a new table row for each element of `inventory`.

The output tags like `<%= inventory[i].item %>` work as before, injecting the values of the expression (each element of inventory's properties/columns) into the HTML.

The most interesting use of the output tags here is setting a hyperlink for the "Info / Edit" button to the corresponding item detail page, based on the `id` property/column:

```ejs
<a class="..." href=<%= "/stuff/item/" + inventory[i].id %> >
```

Restart the server and visit `localhost:8080/stuff`. Even more magic! You should see the table filled with multiple rows containing information for each item in the database - and clicking the buttons navigates to the matching item detail pages!

> Instead of a `for` loop, you could instead use a `forEach` loop or a `for...of` loop to iterate each element in the array directly.
> The EJS would then look like either:
> ```js
>   <% inventory.forEach( elm => { %>
>       <tr>
>           <td><%= elm.item %></td>
>           <td><%= elm.quantity %></td>
>           <td>
>                <a class="btn-small waves-effect waves-light" href=<%= "/stuff/item/" + elm.id %> >...
>           ...
>       </tr>
>   <% }); %>
>```
> or
>```js
>   <% for( const elm of inventory ) { %>
>       <tr>
>           <td><%= elm.item %></td>
>           <td><%= elm.quantity %></td>
>           <td>
>                <a class="btn-small waves-effect waves-light" href=<%= "/stuff/item/" + elm.id %> >...
>           ...
>       </tr>
>   <% } %>
>```

## (4.4) Conclusion:

We now have a fully connected 3-layer web app! Using SQL queries and EJS, the server  renders the HTML upon request, transforming our static pages into dynamic ones that deliver live content.

> In the tutorials so far, we first prototyped the pages, then designed the database accordingly, wrote queries, and finally modified the prototype into a template based on the queries. There is no requirement, however, that you always follow the same process: the template could come before the data queries are written, or the database could come before the protoypes. You might even skip the protoype step altogether, if you have a strong idea of how the various layers will interact from the start.

The next steps are to fully implement the forms so that they produce "`POST`" requests to create and update entries in the database, as well as make the delete buttons also update the database.
